# AKorange
AKorange is a border theme with what I think is a uniq min/max icon.
AY-RED is another of my themes, they are clones of each other with color changes, icons, and a few dimensions.

Note: I also have a 2 Icon Theme repositories that you may want to download.

INSTALLATION:
Copy the AKorange folder into ~/.themes folder for personal use.
Copy to /usr/share/themes for global use.
Use Settings->Themes to select the theme for borders.
